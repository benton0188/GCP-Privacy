# GCP-Privacy

This repository will support an array of detections and remediations for privacy related findings that can be present in a cloud environment. It will contain both code to detect findings but also questions to consider when moving data in a Google Cloud environment. The information contained in this repository is a mixture of frameworks, code and work created by others and my own ideas. Where information is sourced by others, they will be referenced accordingly.
